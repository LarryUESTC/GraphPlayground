# Graph Playground (_vsion-0.1_)

![image](utils/data/github.png)

Graph Playground is a highy emsamble project for Graph Neural Network (_GNN_), using pytorch framwork and other supporting packages (DGL, Torch Geometric, Ray, etc).
The goal of this project is to build a framework that is easy to get started with, highly integrated, and unified.

**Currently in the process of updating...Not enough tasks, datasets and methods are supported, pls be patient.**
# Main Install:
- python 3.9  
- pytorch 1.10.0_cuda11.3
- torch_geometric
- dgl
- ray

Full installed packages, pls see requirements (not all of them are needed)

# Quickly Use:
Set your choose in main.py Line. 148:

Task (e.g.,  `task = 'Semi'    # choice: Semi Unsup Sup Rein Noise Fed`)

Method (e.g., `method = 'Gcn'  # choice: Gcn Gat Sage DGI...`)

Dataset (e.g., `dataset = 'Cora' # choice: Cora CiteSeer PubMed freebase Photo Computers...`)

And Run:

`python main.py`
